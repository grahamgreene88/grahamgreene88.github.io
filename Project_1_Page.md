## Antibiotic Resistance Prediction

**Project description:** The bacteria *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* frequently infects hospitalized patients and has high morbidity and mortality rates. With antibiotic resistance emerging as a major problem in effective *P. aeruginosa* treatment, innovative testing methods are in high-demand to better inform drug prescriptions. 

The aim of this project is to build a classification model to accurately predict the susceptiblity of *P. aeruginosa* isolates to the commonly-used drug tobramycin. The model will be trained using *orfN* gene sequences, a gene which has been shown to mutate first to convey tobramycin resistance in the bacteria.

This model will hopefully serve as the basis for a rapid anti-microbial susceptibility testing method (AST). Using only one type of gene means significantly less data will be required compared to other proposed methods.

This work is a revisited portion of the research I conducted with Dr. Laurence Yang at Queen's University during the 4th year of my chemical engineering degree.

### 1. Importing Data & Cleaning

Several different datasets were used in this project. The two main datasets were one that contained the gene sequence data and the second one contained the resistance phenotype data. These datasets were cross-referenced to retain only the isolates for which we had all the necessary data.

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
