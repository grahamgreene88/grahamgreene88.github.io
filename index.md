### Antibiotic Resistance Prediction
As part of my 4th year research, I built a classification model to predict antibiotic resistance in the deadly pathogen *Pseudomonas Aeruginosa*. Specific emphasis was placed on optimizing the model's recall to minimize false negatives which could lead to deadly patient outcomes in a clinical setting.
